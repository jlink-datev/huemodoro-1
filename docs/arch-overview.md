Introduction and Goals {#section-introduction-and-goals}
======================

Huemodoro is a pomodoro timer with a twist:

The current session state is signalled via a colorful frontend and a connected hue IoT lightbulb.
Sessions can be started, paused and resetted. 




Stakeholders {#_stakeholders}

Hans uses huemodoro via a web-frontend. 
The lightbulb is connected via huebridge -- an external component.

Whitebox Overall System {#_whitebox_overall_system}

### Motivation

Overall arch follows a ports and adapters pattern.
This way the domain can be developed independently from the infrastructure parts.

### Contained Building Blocks

*Domain* contains business logic.

*Web* encapsulates tech infrastructure for backend.

*Frontend* provides a browser ui.

For architectural details on Angular frontend:
`npm run compodoc`


<!-- List of classes in packages -->

### Important Interfaces


Frontend interacts with the backend session through the ` SessionRepository` interface.
It supports (running, stopping , resetting, reloading, advancing)

<!-- TODO other interfaces -->

Deployment View {#section-deployment-view}
===============

![](deployment.png)

Huemodoro is deployed as a single jar file.
Huebridge must be reachable via configured ip-address.
